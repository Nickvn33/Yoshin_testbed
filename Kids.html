            <p class="kids-content">Our Junior Program teaches a modified karate syllabus, children in this program follow the same grade
                structure as the adult program except for the Judo component of our program. Depending on your child's
                progress he or she may be introduced to “Throw downs”. The program introduces children to the many benefits
                of traditional karate training such as fitness, focus, respect, courtesy, self-defense and most importantly;
                a non-quitting spirit. Training focuses on developing karate skills; there is also an emphasis on improving
                self-confidence, how to keep safe, learning respect and responsibility for others.</p>

            <h2>Beginner</h2>
            <p class="adults-content">Making the decision to start Karate is a very BIG step in your life. Congratulations. We endeavor to present
                to you the true way of Karate, or “Karate-Do”, that is, a way to develop total fitness: mind, body and
                spirit. Making an investment in your personal development isn't to be taken lightly, and as such, we commit
                to giving you the best instruction possible.<br><br>Our system allows you to ease into the training program
                slowly and safely. It is not necessary that you have any previous karate experience. You progress at a pace
                consistent with your ability and level of fitness. Everyone is treated as an individual. We fully appreciate
                that you may not be super-fit or flexible right from the start. We will work with you and track your
                progress as a beginner to ensure you realize your true potential as a student of Karate.<br><br>For new
                beginners we offer the first month free.<br><br>Please wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing
                such as a t-shirt and full-length tracksuit pants and arrive 15 minutes early so we can show you around
                before the class starts.<br><br>In these lessons you’ll learn some basic karate techniques, and get a feel
                for how things operate in a karate class, so you can move comfortably into regular training.<br><br>You
                will not participate in any sparring or fighting until you have earned your 10th Kyu (Yellow belt). This
                safety measure is in place to protect both you and other students. Learning proper distance and control
                is a key part of the curriculum.
            </p>

            <p class="adults-content">Have you studied martial arts before? Would you like to try again? At our school we happily accept former
                martial arts students who wish to get started again. We fully appreciate your previous experience when you
                re-commence training. Although you may have achieved a particular belt/rank in another style, you will be
                assessed for recognition of prior learning. The levels you achieved will be considered and we will gladly
                expedite your progress with us as you learn our syllabus. We encourage you to see our dojo and watch a class
                to see if our style is right for you.

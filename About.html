                <p class="history-content">The original club began as “Shinto Yoshin Ryu Jujitsu” in 1883 (approximately) by Sensei Yuki Yoshi
                    Tatsusaburo Nakayama, who designed an "Atemi" style which stressed striking and kicking.<br><br> On
                    June 1st 1921 Sensei Nakayama handed over the running of the school to Sensei Hironori Otsuka, (who
                    was later to founder Wado Kai style of Karate).<br><br> In 1940, when Jujitsu had lost its popular
                    appeal to other martial arts such as Judo, Aikido and the new Karate, the Budokan required all clubs
                    and styles of martial arts to register their style names, and Senseis.<br><br>It was at this time
                    that Sensei Otsuka decided to become "Wado Kai Karate", and so the Shinto Yoshin Ryu Jujitsu style
                    lapsed.<br><br>It was rekindled in Australia on the 2nd February 1960 with the registration of the
                    Willow Heart School of Judo at the RSL Hall, Station Street, Fairfield, Victoria.<br></p>
